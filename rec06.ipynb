    "Kmeans is an unsupervised clustering algorithm, useful for big data analysis, as it allows compressing the data into clusters based on their similarity. The general idea of the algorithm is to start with a random initialization of cluster centers and then assign each data sample to the nearest cluster by measuring its distance to all cluster centers. The process is repeated iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by intializing our object for kmeans. The main parameter of kmeans clustering algorithm is the number of clusters to form, given by parameter `n_clusters` in the function below. Other paramters include `init` which specifies the method for initialization of cluster centroids and `random_state` which is a fixed seed used by the random number generator. Fixing the random number generator seed allows replicating results with repeated runs, otherwise repeated run could be initialzed with different random seeds giving different outputs. "
